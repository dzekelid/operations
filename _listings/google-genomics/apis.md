  genomic information and make it accessible and useful. Big genomic data is here
  today, with petabytes rapidly growing toward exabytes. Through our extensions to
  Google Cloud Platform, you can apply the same technologies that power Google Search
  and Maps to securely store, process, explore, and share large, complex datasets.
