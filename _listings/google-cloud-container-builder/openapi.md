      summary: Get Operation State
      description: |-
        Gets the latest state of a long-running operation.  Clients can use this
        method to poll the operation result at intervals as recommended by the API
        service.

      summary: Cancel Operation
      description: |-
        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
        Operations.GetOperation or
        other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
        operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
        the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
        an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
        corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
